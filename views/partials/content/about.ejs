	<h1> EDIS Publication System</h1>
	<p>The EDIS website is your Every Day Information Source. It is a comprehensive, single-source repository of all current UF/IFAS numbered peer-reviewed publications. </p>
	<p>UF/IFAS <a href="departments/index.html">academic departments</a> develop and maintain a collection of publications available for universal free distribution on the web and through UF/IFAS Extension <a href="http://solutionsforyourlife.ufl.edu/map/">County Offices</a> and <a href="http://solutionsforyourlife.ufl.edu/map/#rec_rds">Research and Education Centers</a> statewide. Each year, visitors to the EDIS website access one of over 7,000 publication titles more than 26 million times.  A streamlined publication process, universal web access, and print as needed services not only reduce the cost but also expand the impact of UF/IFAS  publications.</p>
    <h1>History</h1>
	<p>UF/IFAS has had a long history of providing electronic access to publications, beginning in the early 1990s when it began producing handbooks of documents on CD ROMS.  The Florida Agricultural Information Retrieval System (FAIRS) website first went online in May 1995 and continued until 1998 when the name was changed to Extension Data Information Source (EDIS) to reflect changes in scope and function. EDIS became the single source for all Extension publications and was also adapted to permit extension units to print documents on an as-needed basis. More  recently, the UF/IFAS <a href="http://solutionsforyourlife.ifas.ufl.edu/">Solutions for Your Life</a> Web initiative has brought EDIS  publications together with other valuable Web resources within the framework in  a single Web-user friendly theme and framework.</p>
	<h1>Funding</h1>
	<p>Resources for the daily operation of the EDIS publication system are allocated to EDIS through the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. The publications are the output of UF/IFAS <a href="http://pdec.ifas.ufl.edu/">Extension programs</a>.</p>
