    "abstract" : "Variety choice is a critical management decision in producing a peanut crop. Since several good peanut varieties are available, it is essential to know each variety?s attributes and how different varieties might fit into a farm plan. This 7-page fact sheet provides data conducted from trials in Florida at UF/IFAS research centers located in Gainesville (Citra), Marianna, and Jay from 2010?2013.

    "title" : "Can Maternal Colostrum Be Replaced by Commercial Products for Feeding Newborn Calves?",

    "author" : "Klibs N. Galvao",
    "abstract" : "Colostrum management and feeding are critical for calf health, calves? future productive life, and farm profitability. Current recommendations state that a calf needs to ingest at least 150?200 g of immunoglobulin G within two hours of birth, but when colostrum quality is poor or unavailable, colostrum replacer may be a suitable alternative. This 3-page fact sheet presents the results of a recent publication that evaluated the effects of feeding maternal colostrum, one dose of plasma-derived colostrum replacer, or one dose of colostrum-derived colostrum replacer on serum total protein, immunoglobulin G concentration, calf morbidity, calf mortality, and weight gain from birth to weaning.

    "title" : "What Is the Most Cost-Effective Breeding Program for Breeding Heifers: Timed AI, Estrous Detection, or a Combination of Both?",
    "image" : "/images/VM199_thumbnail.jpg", 
    "author" : "Klibs N. Galvão, Eduardo S. Ribeiro, and Jose Eduardo P. Santos",
    "abstract" : "As any other business enterprise, the sustainability of a dairy farm is highly dependent on economics. In order to obtain a profitable return on assets, there is a constant need to maximize outputs and, oftentimes, to minimize inputs. Reproduction influences both milk production and number of replacement heifers available on a farm; therefore, reproductive efficiency becomes a key determinant of dairy cow profitability. This 3-page fact sheet presents information from recently published work that looked at the economics of different reproductive programs for breeding heifers that use timed AI only, estrus detection only, or a combination of both. Written by Klibs N. Galv�o, Eduardo S. Ribeiro, and Jose Eduardo P. Santos, and published by the UF Department of Veterinary Medicine-Large Animal Clinical Sciences, May 2014.",
